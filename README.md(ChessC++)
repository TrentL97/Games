                                           WELCOME TO THE GAME OF CHESS                                                                
Player one starts the game on the bottom of the board and player two follows in this classic chess game. The objective of the game is to put the opponent's king in checkmate such that it is in check and unable to move out of check. Check is achieved by putting the opponent's king in the line of movement of your piece. The player whose king is in check must subsequently get their king out of check by either moving their king from danger, taking the imposing piece, or by shielding the king from the imposing piece. Every piece has their own unique strengths and weaknesses as you will figure out in your advancement in chess. The pawns, of which each player has 8, only move forward one space at a time. They can only take opponent's pieces by moving diagonally forward (left or right).The rooks and bishop (2 per player) enjoy an unlimited range of movement, however; the bishops can only move diagonally and the rooks move solely in the horizontal and vertical directions. The knights, of which there are also 2 per player, must move both horizontally and vertically. This is accomplished by moving either 1 or 2 spaces vertically, and then the by the other amount horizontally (for a total of three spaces thus allowing for 8 combinations). Each player has only one king and queen, both of which enjoy unlimited degrees of movement (diagonal and lateral). The queen is able to traverse any number of spaces while the king is limited to one space at a time.

Gameplay: After one player completes their turn, the turn is automatically passed to the opponent, and this gameplay is repeated until one player is put into checkmate, or until either player voluntarily leaves the game. At the start of the turn, the player chooses from a variety of keys to move their various pieces, all of which are described in the legend. Alternatively: the player can press 'l' to pull up the legend, 'm' to pull up this manual, 'n' to pull up the redacted form of this manual (containing just the gameplay paragraph), or 'z' to leave the game. Once the player has chosen a piece, they can enter 'p' if they would like to change to a different piece. All illegal moves, such as hopping pieces, taking friendly pieces, moving outside the boardspace, taking the enemy king, and putting your own king into check, are filtered and will cause an error message to appear.
